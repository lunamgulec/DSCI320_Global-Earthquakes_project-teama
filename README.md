# GroupA - Global Earthquakes

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We chose a real-time earthquake dataset provided by the U.S.Geological Survey (USGS), a reputable U.S. government scientific agency that provides authoritative, open-access data on natural phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, water resources, and land use. 

The USGS collects this data through a global network of seismic monitoring stations that continuously detect and record seismic activity. Each record in the dataset contains detailed attributes, such as location (latitude and longitude), time of occurrence, and more (detailed below).

The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program via https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php.

The feed provides real-time earthquake data that is updated every minute and can be filtered/chosen per time range (past hour, week, or month). We decided to download a static version of “All Earthquakes” under “Per month” and use this single version for our project. This ensures our findings are based on a fixed dataset and allows us to avoid confusion, unmatched data, or any discrepancies. 


## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Oour motivation is to understand global earthquake data and showcase how data visualisation can make such scientific information accessible, as well as improving our own skills in data analysis and visualisation in Python (specifically Pandas and Altair) and storytelling skills.
